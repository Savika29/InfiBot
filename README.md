InfiBot is an internal HR assistant chatbot built using Python Flask that helps employees quickly access HR policies and corporate information.
It answers common queries like leave rules, work-from-home policies, and reimbursement limits through a simple chat interface.
The project uses a rule-based approach to provide instant responses and reduce repetitive HR queries.
